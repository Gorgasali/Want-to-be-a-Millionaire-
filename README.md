Game to play with friends or on your own.

This game will be played on the command line and take users input. The game consists of answering questions and earning money till either a question is answered incorrectly and the game is over or they reach $1,000,000 and are declared the winner. If the user is stuck there is a lifeline method which will allow users to take 2 wrong answers off of the question, a hint on the question being asked, and finally the 25 which takes off one wrong answer.
